# Writing Assignment

## 1. Your history [200 - 500 words]

I am currently employed at Capitec Bank and am on a journey shaped by resilience, adaptability, and ambition. I began my academic path studying BSc Physical Sciences at the University of Pretoria, driven by a lifelong dream of becoming a scientist. However, due to financial constraints, I was unable to complete the degree. Over time, I also realized that my passion for science was fading.

Seeking a new direction, I enrolled in Accounting Sciences through UNISA while working full-time. I wasn’t fully aware of the challenge I was taking on, but it has proven to be both demanding and rewarding. Balancing work and study has tested my discipline and commitment, and I’ve grown significantly both professionally and personally.

I am someone who thrives on challenge, a natural analytical thinker and above all a winner. These core traits have shaped my evolving career goals. With a strong foundation in analytical reasoning and a growing understanding of finance and data, I’ve developed a clear vision: to become a quantitative analyst. This role perfectly combines my technical mindset with my passion for problem-solving, making it a natural next step in my career journey.

## 2. Why do you want this career? [100 - 300 words]

I want a career as a quantitative analyst because it combines my analytical strengths with my growing interest in finance. I’ve always enjoyed solving complex problems and thinking strategically. While my academic journey started in physical sciences, I later transitioned into accounting science where I discovered the powerful role data plays in financial decision-making. Working at Capitec while studying has shown me how much I enjoy applying logic to real world challenges. A career in quantitative analysis offers continuous learning, intellectual challenge, and the opportunity to make data-driven decisions. All of which align with my personality, strengths, and long-term professional goals.

## 3. Your free time [ <= 300 words]
In my free time, I like to relax and do things that help me unwind and stay sharp. One of my favorite hobbies is playing games like chess. I enjoy the challenge it brings and how it helps me think a few steps ahead, which also reflects how I approach problems in general.

I also enjoy spending time with family and friends, listening to music, and going for walks. These simple things help me recharge after a busy day or week.

When I’m not relaxing, I like learning new things. Sometimes I watch educational videos or read articles about finance, data, or technology. I’m naturally curious, so I enjoy discovering how things work, especially when it relates to my career goals.

Because I work and study at the same time, I don’t always have a lot of free time but I try to make the most of it. Whether I’m learning something new, playing a game of chess, or just enjoying some quiet time. I always try to keep a good balance between work, study, and rest.

## 4. Relevant experience [ <= 300 words]

I’ve gained relevant experience both through work and study. While working at Procter & Gamble, I was part of the Business Administration team. A big part of my role involved pulling data from Power BI and cleaning it in Excel. I made sure the information was clear and easy for the customer team to understand. This helped me build strong skills in working with data, attention to detail, and communication.

Currently, I work at Capitec Bank while studying Accounting Science through UNISA. This experience has taught me time management, discipline, and given me a deeper understanding of finance and business.

Before that, I studied Physical Science at the University of Pretoria, which built my problem-solving and analytical thinking.

These experiences have helped me realise that I enjoy working with numbers, solving problems, and finding meaning in data, all of which are key skills for a future career as a quantitative analyst.

## 5. What makes you think you’ll succeed as a coder? [<= 300 words]

I believe I’ll succeed as a coder because I’m a problem-solver at heart. From a young age, I’ve enjoyed working through challenges and thinking logically, skills that are key in programming. My background in Physical Science and current studies in Accounting Science have both helped me build a strong analytical mindset.

At Procter & Gamble, I worked with data daily, pulling it from Power BI and cleaning it in Excel so that teams could make better decisions. This experience taught me how to break down complex information and make it clear  something that’s also important in writing clean, understandable code.

I’m also someone who doesn’t give up easily. Whether it’s balancing work and studies or learning something new from scratch, I stay focused until I get it right. I’ve started exploring coding on my own, and while it can be challenging, I enjoy the learning process and how every small improvement builds up over time.

Lastly, I’m very analytical and detail-oriented I like finding better, more efficient ways to do things. Coding gives me the perfect space to apply that mindset.

With my determination, logical thinking, and love for solving problems, I’m confident I’ll succeed as a coder.

## 6. What might get in the way of your success? [<= 300 words]

I was studying during the first semester, but I have not decided to enroll this semester because of the current data analytics opportunity. If I’m successful, I would first need time to adjust to the new role and responsibilities. Once I’ve settled in, I can then consider continuing with my studies.

One thing that might get in the way of my success is time. I’m working and studying, so it can be hard to fit in extra learning like coding. But I’m learning to manage my time better and make room for what matters.

Another challenge is that I don’t have a coding background yet. I know I’ll need to put in extra effort, but I enjoy learning and I’m not afraid to start from the beginning.

Sometimes I doubt myself, but I’ve overcome many challenges before. I believe that with hard work and focus, nothing can stop me from reaching my goals.

## 7. Your routine
My daily routine begins when I wake up and start the day with prayer, grounding myself spiritually. After that, I clean my room to create a tidy and focused environment, followed by personal hygiene. I then head to the gym to work on my physical health before going to work. Once the workday ends, I dedicate time to personal development or part-time reading, depending on my goals and energy levels. If I have extra time in the evening, I unwind by watching a movie or a series. Finally, I take a shower and go to bed, preparing myself for the next day.

## 8. Your future: the good parts

In the future, I see myself working in a job I enjoy one that challenges me, helps me grow, and allows me to use my skills every day. I want to become a quantitative analyst because it brings together everything I enjoy solving problems, working with data, and learning new things.

One of the best parts of my future will be feeling confident in my abilities and knowing that I’ve worked hard to get where I am. I look forward to being part of a team, doing meaningful work, and helping others through what I know. I also want to be in a position where I can support my family, keep learning, and have more freedom in life.

More than anything, I want to do work that matters, work that helps people make smarter decisions using data. I’m excited about the journey ahead and the person I’m becoming as I work toward that future.

## 9. Your future: the scary parts

What scares me most about the future is the unknown. I’m working hard toward my goals, but I don’t always know what’s coming, and that can feel overwhelming. I sometimes question whether I’m doing enough, or whether I’ll be ready for the challenges that come with the career I want.

Another fear is the pressure of learning new things like coding and advanced data analysis. It’s exciting, but also a big responsibility. I know it won’t be easy, and balancing work, studying, and life can be exhausting at times. I worry about burning out or falling behind.

But more than anything, the thought of losing my loved ones scares me. My family and close friends are a big part of my support system, and life feels uncertain without them. That fear reminds me to be present and appreciate the people I care about while I work toward the future.

Even with these fears, I believe I can keep moving forward. I’ve faced hard times before and grown from them. I know that fear is part of the journey — and I choose to keep going anyway.
## 10. Your current commitments

Right now, I’m working full-time at Capitec Bank. It’s a big part of my daily routine and helps me grow professionally while supporting myself and my goals. I’m also studying Accounting Sciences through UNISA, although I’ve paused my studies this semester to focus on a potential opportunity in data analytics.

Outside of work, I spend time on personal development. I read, watch educational content, and work on building skills that align with my long-term goals, like data and coding. I also try to stay consistent with the gym, prayer, and spending time with loved ones, which help me stay balanced.

Even though I have a lot on my plate, I’m learning how to manage my time better and stay focused on what matters most right now.

## 11. The importance of doing your own work

Doing your own work is important because it’s the only way to truly learn and grow. When you put in the effort yourself, you understand the process, not just the result. It builds confidence, discipline, and real knowledge — things you can’t get by copying someone else.

It also helps you take pride in your progress. Even if the work is hard or takes time, knowing that you did it on your own makes the outcome more meaningful. You also learn from your mistakes, which is part of getting better.

In the long run, doing your own work builds good habits and strong character. Whether it’s studying, coding, or working toward a career goal, the effort you put in now shapes the kind of person you become.
